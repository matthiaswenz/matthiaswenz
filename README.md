### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ðŸš´ ðŸšµ

I'm Mat. I work for [GitHub](https://github.com) as an Engineering Manager, focusing on making GitHub an even greater experience for the global developer community.

Outside of work, I love to travel and be active outdoors, [riding bikes](https://www.strava.com/athletes/8835873) and [going on hikes](https://www.komoot.com/user/496270403855). You can check out my [most recent activity](https://gist.github.com/matthiaswenz/a11e895c107e2c236be561bc15dbc9d6) below.
